JAVA BASICS


a simple console aplication that do CRUD operation for organize persons 


CRUD means C(create)R(read)U(update)D(delete)



used basic concepts of java just like variables,primitive data types,operators,conditions and loops

what happen in this project?

1)CREATE 

Register a new member

1) The computer program takes the person's data from the user
2) Member information is recorded
3) The person's membership number is displayed

2)READ

Display a member's information

1) The program receives the membership number
2) The program displays person's information
3) If such a member is missing, it will print the appropriate error message

3)UPDATE

Edit member information

1) The program receives the membership number
2) The new value receives and records each of the person's properties
3) If such a member is missing, it will print the appropriate error message

4)DELETE

Delete a member

1) The program receives the membership number
2) If there is a member with this number, the program will delete the person's information
3) otherwise it will print the appropriate error message

TIPS
1) for each property i considered an array
2) i considered a boolean array for seeing empty houses
3) When registering a member, the amount of   corresponding person's house in this array is true
4) When deletinga member, the amount of   corresponding person's house in this array is false
5) The same needs can be met with better methods such as Object-Oriented Programming
6) There are no members at the beginning of the program
7) By closing the program, all information is lost
8) This problem can be solved with another features like registration information in the file or database
